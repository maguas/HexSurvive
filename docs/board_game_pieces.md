## Design Notes

### 3D Miniatures Priority
Only heroes, outposts, and fortresses are 3D pieces to:
- Keep manufacturing costs reasonable
- Focus premium feel on player interaction pieces
- Make gameplay visually clear and tactile
- Simplified from original design (removed patrol figures)

### Dual-Purpose Encounter Cards (One Deck Dungeon System)
- **Design Philosophy**: Encounter cards serve double duty as equipment
- **Left edge (~30%)**: Equipment stats and bonuses
- **Right portion (~70%)**: Enemy encounter details
- **After victory**: Tuck card under Hero card, showing only equipment portion
- **Hero Progression**: Heroes grow stronger ONLY through collected equipment (no XP system)
- **Benefits**:
  - Eliminates need for 30-40 separate equipment cards
  - Reduces manufacturing cost by ~$2-3 per unit
  - Streamlines gameplay (defeat enemy = gain loot in one action)
  - Creates visual hero progression (cards stacked under hero)
  - Less table space and storage needed
  - Simpler than XP tracking

### Token Economy Design
- **Catan-style resource quantities**: 19 per resource type (95 total)
- Proven resource economy that creates strategic scarcity without frustration
- Wooden discs with icons chosen for:
  - Clear visual identification and accessibility
  - Premium tactile feel at reasonable cost
  - Easy stacking and storage
- Equal distribution across all 5 resource types for balanced gameplay

### Board Size Considerations
- 18" x 20" play area fits standard table space
- 37 hex tiles with 2.5" size allows clear visibility and placement
- Leaves room for player boards on sides
- Hex size accommodates miniature bases comfortably
