# Xeno-Hex: Resistance
**A Post-Apocalyptic Survival Board Game**
*2-4 Players | 45-60 Minutes*

## 1. Overview
In a world overrun by alien invaders, players lead factions of the human resistance. You must explore the ruined landscape, gather resources, train heroes, and fight back against the alien threat. The game blends the resource management and building of *Catan* with the squad-based combat and exploration of *XCOM* and *One Deck Dungeon*.

## 2. Objective
The first player to reach **10 Victory Points (VP)** wins.
VPs are gained by:
- Building **Outposts** (1 VP)
- Upgrading to **Fortresses** (2 VP)
- Defeating **Alien Bosses** (1-2 VP)
- **Secret Objective**: Completing your hidden agenda (3 VP).
- **Global Threat Limit**: If Threat reaches **Level 3 + Full Track**, all players lose.

> **Semi-Cooperative**: You must work together to keep Threat < 10, but only one player can win by reaching 10 VP first.
