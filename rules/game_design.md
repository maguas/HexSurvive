# Xeno-Hex: Resistance
**A Post-Apocalyptic Survival Board Game**
*2-4 Players | 45-60 Minutes*

## 1. Overview
In a world overrun by alien invaders, players lead factions of the human resistance. You must explore the ruined landscape, gather resources, train heroes, and fight back against the alien threat. The game blends the resource management and building of *Catan* with the squad-based combat and exploration of *XCOM* and *One Deck Dungeon*.

## 2. Objective
The first player to reach **10 Victory Points (VP)** wins.
VPs are gained by:
- Building **Outposts** (1 VP)
- Upgrading to **Fortresses** (2 VP)
- Defeating **Alien Bosses** (1-2 VP)
- **Secret Objective**: Completing your hidden agenda (3 VP).
- **Global Threat Limit**: If Threat reaches **Level 3 + Full Track**, all players lose.

> **Semi-Cooperative**: You must work together to keep Threat < 10, but only one player can win by reaching 10 VP first.

## Setup

1. The game starts with all tiles face-down (unrevealed)
2. **Initial Placement (2-Step Process)**:
   - **Step 1**: Click on any tile center to place your initial Outpost (reveals it, assigns number token, grants +1 VP)
   - **Step 2**: Click on any edge of that Outpost tile to place your Hero
3. **Starting Resources**: 1 Fuel, 0 of everything else.
    - **Initial Explore**: Immediately reveal the tile adjacent to the Hero's edge.
- **Secret Objective**:4. All players draw 1 Secret Objective card (worth 2-3 VP, kept secret)

## Turn Structure

Each turn has 3 phases:
1. **Production Phase**: Roll 2d6 for resource production or "The Invasion" (on 7)
   - **Passive Income**: At start of each turn, gain resources from outposts:
     - Each Outpost: +1 Fuel, +1 Food
     - Each Fortress: +2 Fuel, +2 Food
- Roll 2d6.
- **Sum 2-6, 8-12**: Any visible tile with this number produces 1 resource for players with an Outpost adjacent to it.
- **Sum 7 (The Invasion)**: 
    - No production.
    - **Alien Patrol**: 
        - **Spawn/Move**: Active player chooses to **Add** a new Patrol (Max 2 on board) OR **Move** an existing one.
        - **Effect**: Blocks production. Heroes on adjacent edges take 1 damage when moving.
    - **Panic**: Players with >7 cards discard half.

## Resource Gathering

- When you roll the dice (not 7), resource tiles with matching numbers produce resources
- **Restriction**: Only tiles **adjacent to the hero** (the 2 tiles touching the hero's edge) can produce resources
- **Standard Outpost**: Produces 1 resource per roll
- **Fortress**: Produces 2 resources per roll
- Tiles blocked by Alien Patrols do not produce.

### Phase 2: Action Phase
Perform any number of actions:
1. **Trade**: Exchange resources with players or the Bank (4:1 default).
2. **Build/Recruit**:
    - **Outpost** (1 Scrap, 1 Food, 1 Fuel): Place on a corner connected to your Hero's edge. (Limit: Distance rule applies).
    - **Fortress** (2 Scrap, 3 Alloy): Upgrade Outpost. Double production.
    - **Train Hero** (1 Food, 1 Intel): XP / Skill Up.
    - **Craft Gear** (Cost varies): Equip your Hero.
    - **Clean Nest** (2 Fuel, 2 Alloy): Remove Xeno-Nest. -1 Threat. Replace with random tile.
## Hero Movement & Exploration (Edge-Based)

- Heroes occupy **edges** between hexes (not tile centers)
- **Move** (Costs 2 Fuel): Move hero to an adjacent edge
  - Only clickable during Action Phase
  - Moving to a new edge reveals both adjacent tiles and assigns number tokens
  - Draws an encounter card from the current Threat Level deck for each newly revealed tile
  - Valid moves: edges that share a vertex with current edge (4 possible moves) triggers a draw from the current **Threat Level Deck**.
        - **Types**: Resource Stash, Alien Tech, Hazard, Xeno-Nest, Alien Encounter.
        - **Rewards**: 
            - **XP**: Gain 1 XP Cube per success.
            - **Loot**: Tuck card under Hero to equip Gear/Skills (if applicable).
4. **Combat (Quick Resolution)**:
    - **Dice Pool**: Roll Hero Dice (Stats + Gear).
    - **Target**: Enemy has a **Defense Value** (e.g., 10) and **Required Slots** (e.g., 1x Red).
    - **Resolution**: 
        - Assign dice to Slots first.
        - Sum remaining dice. If Sum >= Defense, Enemy defeated.
        - **Failure**: Hero takes 1 Injury AND **Threat Track increases by 1**. (Applies to Patrols too).
    - **Co-op Assist**:
        - Another player adjacent to the encounter can join.
        - Combine Dice Pools.
        - **Rewards**: XP is shared. Loot/Resources are split (Roll d6: High roll picks first).
    - **Death**: If Health reaches 0, Hero respawns at nearest Outpost and is **Inactive** for 1 turn.
    - **Fast Paced**: No multi-round combat. One roll, one result.

## 6. The Hero
