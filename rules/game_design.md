# Xeno-Hex: Resistance
**A Post-Apocalyptic Survival Board Game**
*2-4 Players | 60-90 Minutes*

## 1. Overview
In a world overrun by alien invaders, players lead factions of the human resistance. You must explore the ruined landscape, gather resources, train heroes, and fight back against the alien threat. The game blends the resource management and building of *Catan* with the squad-based combat and exploration of *XCOM* and *One Deck Dungeon*.

## 2. Objective
The first player to reach **10 Victory Points (VP)** wins.
VPs are gained by:
- Building **Outposts** (1 VP)
- Upgrading to **Fortresses** (2 VP)
- Defeating **Alien Bosses** (1-2 VP)
- Completing **Secret Missions** (1 VP)
- Building the **Comm-Link** (2 VP)

## 5. Turn Structure

### Phase 1: The Roll (Production & Threat)
Roll 2d6.
- **Sum 2-6, 8-12**: Any visible tile with this number produces 1 resource for players with an Outpost adjacent to it.
- **Sum 7 (The Invasion)**: 
    - No production.
    - Players with >7 resource cards must discard half.
    - Active player moves the **Alien Patrol** to a tile. That tile stops producing. 
    - Draw an **Event Card** (usually bad news).

### Phase 2: Action Phase
Perform any number of actions:
1. **Trade**: Exchange resources with players or the Bank (4:1 default).
2. **Build/Recruit**:
    - **Outpost** (1 Scrap, 1 Food, 1 Fuel): Place on a corner of a revealed tile. (Limit: Distance rule applies).
    - **Fortress** (2 Scrap, 3 Alloy): Upgrade Outpost. Double production.
    - **Train Hero** (1 Food, 1 Intel): XP / Skill Up.
    - **Craft Gear** (Cost varies): Equip your Hero.
3. **Explore**:
    - Spend 1 **Fuel** + 1 **Food**.
    - Reveal a face-down tile adjacent to one of your Outposts or revealed tiles.
    - **Tile Level**: Determine level based on distance from HQ.
    - Place a random Number Token on it.
    - **Encounter Trigger**: Exploring triggers an Encounter Card of the tile's Level.
4. **Combat**:
    - If an Alien unit is on the board or triggered via Encounter, your Hero attacks.
    - Roll Combat Dice (d6s) based on Hero stats + Gear.
    - **Mechanic**: Like *One Deck Dungeon*, place dice to cover enemy slots.
    - **Win**: Get Loot (Gear) / XP. **Lose**: Hero takes damage/Injury.

Each player controls **one unique Commander**. 
- **Leveling**: XP gained from combat/research unlocks skills.
- **Gear Slots**: Head, Body, Weapon, Tech.
- **Stats**:
    - **Tactics (Yellow)**: Ranged attacks, flanking.
    - **Strength (Red)**: Heavy weapons, armor breaking.
    - **Tech (Blue)**: Hacking, using alien tech.

## 7. Resources
